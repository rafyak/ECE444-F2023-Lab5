### Pros and Cons of Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Test-Driven Development (TDD) has many advantages in software development. Most notably, TDD allows for the creation of more reliable code. By writing tests prior to code, developers are made to consider the design of their code at an early stage in the development cycle. This leads to cleaner, more maintable code. TDD also encourages code modularity, as tests are typically written to focus on specific functionality or small units of code. This drives the developer to then write smaller units of code to fulfil the prior-written test's requirements.

However, TDD requires a large initial time investment to write tests before code. This can lead to a slow down of the development process. In addition to the upfront investment, the suite of tests written will require continual maintenance and updating throughout the development cycle, which further slows down the development timeline.
